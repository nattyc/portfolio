            User experience and (effective) user interface design is a crazy gradient of skills that runs the
            gamut from research to structure to design then (not so) finally to
            implementation, with many iterative steps back through those phases
            in order to determine and meet the user's goals. While UX design
            isn't exactly a new field, there is an emerging mindset among
            forward-thinking organizations that bridges the gaps that have
            traditionally existed between research, strategy, architecture,
            design, testing, and development. There is <em>finally</em> a recognition that
            <strong>good design makes people more effective</strong>.

            This is a lot of ground to cover, and I don't think I could
            have covered it all effectively if it weren't for the incredibly
            talented teams I've had the privilege of working with, in addition
            to the two questions that keep me focused, passionate, and curious:
            <em>how? why?</em>

          <p class="description">
            As an industry-leading health and wellness company, XANGO has always been at the forefront
            of maintaining clean and modern design language and brand standards, even through the harsh
            environment that typically surrounds direct sales companies. I work as a Senior Designer with
            an awesome team that tackles projects ranging from shooting and editing new promo videos
            to infographics for social media all the to product packaging. We recently completed the launch of a new lifestyle-centered
            catalog, which I art directed and did layout work on as well as working with a super talented team of models
            stylists, and the great photographer, <a href="http://jessecoss.com">Jesse Coss</a>. We've currently been asked to start a sweeping overhaul of all of our web and mobile properties.
            Our main site and subsequent product family sites will be stripped down to bare essentials in order to act as a
            narrative sales tool for our distributor-customers, and our back office suite is being re-tooled to guide new
            distributors into growing their business quickly with goal and sales tracking checkpoints that distill complex information
            about sales structures into meaningful and actionable analysis. We are achieving this through extensive user testing
            and research as well as rapid iteration through different designs and measuring the effectiveness of these
            choices through monitoring online analytics (bounce rates, engagement time) as well as call center volume
            and standing issues.

            Startups are inherently difficult endeavors
            no matter what, but to add another layer of complexity and risk,
            Blacksmith Mfg. decided to tackle the business of manufacturing
            physical goods overseas. We created a small design team and educated our
            salespeople and clients on different materials and manufacturing
            processes. We also helped guide typically "waterfall"-based companies
            through rapid product development cycles, applying agile
            planning methods to physical manufacturing, working with companies like Activision, Billabong,
            RVCA, Nixon, and many others. Our team created everything from high-level concept
            pitches for product lines all the way down to technical sketches detailing how users
            might interact with the product and the minutiae associated with production.
             Though I haven't worked with the team
            in an official capacity for a while, they recently asked
            me to work with them again on designing a brand new website. Their previous
            site had been geared towards project management in the backend with the public-facing
            side being somewhat neglected. The new site will focus on creating a narrative about the process of
            product development and will highlight the different services they offer to companies looking to get into
            making products for retail.

            Startup Weekend events always get pretty hectic, and this one
            was no exception. I was drafted onto a team to create a new service with
            an accompanying app that enabled business-types at industry events to
            schedule open office-hours with anyone they'd like to network with, with
            a heavy emphasis on interests and actual conversation rather than titles
            and companies. Startup Weekends are also an interesting
            exercise where I get to bring everyone together and quickly step through the typical process of
            goal prioritization, persona-creation, user research, and content strategy
            "workshops" in order to distill a concrete direction for an MVP to present.
            We ended up winning 2nd place overall and taking home the design award (at
            a designed-themed weekend!) and some of the team has moved on to actually building
            out the project.

            I was fortunate enough to be brought on by the talented folks at <a href="http://leverpulley.com/">Lever Pulley</a>,
            a local development agency, on the redesign of the Utah Small Business Development Centers' (a state branch of the federal SBA program).
            They wanted a modern, friendly, and responsive design that highlighted the various education materials, events, and resources
            they bring to small business owners who are struggling to start or grow their business. The design included local
            outreach filters to direct users to the nearest facility as well as event planning resources and interactive
            educational modules and goal tracking baked in from the start. The major challenge was to create something that
            was modular enough to apply across an extensive and deep application but still be freindly and inviting and appeal
            to the wide range of business in Utah, from rural ranchers to a new software development firm in downtown SLC. The stakeholders
            at the SBDC were very receptive to trying out a more modern and collaborative approach to the project, which was a very refreshing change to
            the typical expectation of stacks of Photoshop mockups. We iterated and worked through information architecture, wireframes, style tiles,
            and finally module design.

            <strong>iPlayed.it</strong> - A side project started by developer extraordinaire and my friend Clay Ferris, iPlayed.it
            combines our love of video games with building small, helpful products. The quick pitch: With flash sales and so many
            awesome AAA and indie games coming out lately, gamers' backlogs and wishlists grow pretty rapidly. iPlayed.it helps solve that
            by allowing gamers to quickly create lists to organize and rate games on lists (such as: wishlists, currently playing, beaten, abandoned, etc.)
            and compare and swap items on the lists with friends. In a nutshell: Trello meets Letterboxd for games. Built using Grunt, Sass, and AngularJS
            and the Giant Bomb API.

            <strong>Current</strong> - Borne of frustration with the reporting tools built into the solar photovoltaic array attached to
            my house, an app intended to clean up and distill the complex information surrounding one's monthly
            electricty input and output. Research included reams of power bills from around the country,
            studies into consumption patterns, and limited user interviews. Designed to take a variety of inputs from solar panels, the power meter, and even electricty usage monitors like Watt
            Killer and present the information in an actionable and human-friendly way.  There is also a social component built in, to help you compare
            your usage patterns against friends, which in studies has show to reduce electricty usage. This idea was pitched to the Samsung
            Accelerator at the end of 2013 and led to me being flown to NYC by Adobe to lead panel discussions on the future of design at
            a Behance/99U event, which was a blast!
